# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project was to develop new skills with API requests, look for correlations between independent and dependent variables, 
use linear regression, and work with Google Maps API's as well.  I also dived into the beginnings of how you would create an app, and with
user input, generate suggestions for said user based on their inputs.
